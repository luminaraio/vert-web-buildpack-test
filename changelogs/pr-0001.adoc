## Scope of Feature
This PR provided the initial JenkinsX quick-start template for a *Vert.x Web Service* project
(i.e. a project that does full CI/CD with promotions to the various environments present in our platform).

## How to validate Feature
To effectively validated that the PR does the feature above the following needs to happen:

. Generate a sample project with the *jx* command-line program.
+
Execute:
+
```
jx create quickstart --pack maven-java11 -g luminaraio
```
+
and follow the instruction in the _quickstart import wizard_ and when promoted
(_"select the quickstart you wish to create"_) choose `luminaraio/vertx-web-quickstart`

. Validate that all instances of `vert-web-buildpack-test` are replaced by the name given to the project during step 1
. Run the service (_locally_)
+
Execute:
+
```
cd <generated-project-name>
mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Pvertx-run
```
+
This should start the service on port 8080

. Validate the service is working by making a request
+
Execute:
+
```
curl -s http://localhost:8080
```
+
The response should be:
+
```
{
    "message": "Jenkins X! works like charm... sometimes",
    "status": "OK"
}
```
+

. Wait until the pipeline in *Jenkins X* has fully deployed and then validate that a _successful promotion/deployment to the **staging**_ happened
+
Execute:
+
```
jx get application (1)
curl -s $STAGING_URL (2)
```
* Should return a list of all the services/applications deployed in all your environments
make a not of the staging URL for this application
* Request the staging URL
* A response like the one above should be received
